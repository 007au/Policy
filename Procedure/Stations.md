## Stations

HSBNE encourages members to document in-house systems and processes such that
they are repeatable, thorough, and usable. To this end, we have the Stations
program. The Stations program gives members the opportunity to create a usable
piece of infrastructure and be reimbursed by the group for their initiative.
This means if you build tooling for the space and it's good enough that anyone
can use it, HSBNE can vote to pay you for its building costs.

A Station must have:

- Usage clearly documented in a manner that anyone can follow without assistance
- Ongoing costs documented
- A member nominated as the maintainer

Documentation for already existing stations are posted on the Wiki and
physically at the station itself.

It is reasonable to expect that if you use a station, and break something that
is "expensive", and that can not be attributed to wear-and-tear, then you may be
asked to fix it, or pay for it, or pay for part/most of it.

All Stations have a "responsible person" who's job it is to ensure it remains
usable, that consumables are upkept, that documentation is accurate, etc. This
defaults to the person who "authored" it, untill they publish otherwise on the
list and in the instructions.   The instructions *must* name this person, and
their contact details ( eg phone & email ), so they can be notified in the case
of issues, etc.

All changes to stations ( such as documentation, methodology, systems, etc )
must be "vetted" by the original "author" and/or the current "responsible
person".

Please don't break the documentation.   If you are designing a new/better way of
doing something, the old system must continue to work until your revisions and
documentation are "vetted" and accepted by the author, etc .

If you want to create a new station, these are the steps you’ll need to follow:

**Level 1 Documentation:**  Project Proposal -  for "putting it to the group".
This does not need firm "costings", but estimates will help your proposal. It
is at this point that it is expected that someone unrelated should be able to
follow your instructions without help to use the station.

**Level 2 Documentation:**  Grant Application - justifiable estimates of the
costings, replacement costs, etc. and this is the point at which the ‘station’
must be voted on.

**Level 3 Documentation:**  This is the ongoing "living" document for periodic
review.  Specifying actual cost/s incurred ( both upfront, and consumables )
and sources for replacement parts/consumeables.
