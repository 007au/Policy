## Lifetime Membership

Lifetime Members are members of HSBNE who have either accrued 10 years of
membership or paid up in advance to accrue 10 years of membership. Lifetime
Members do not have to pay for membership to maintain their voting/access
rights. Paying in advance is calculated as

    ( ( 10 * 12 ) - <accrued membership in months> ) * <current cost of bulk membership>
