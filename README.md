## HSBNE Policy

This is a Collaborative Policy Experiment. The aim is to specify a branching
system that follows the lifecycle of real policy, and enables more people to
collaboratively improve these documents.

### Branching

Policy tracks through various branches as it is created, modified and accepted.

* **Master:** Policy documents that are currently live.
* **Draft:** Policy documents that are actively being worked upon. We expect
  to see the majority of work happen either here, or in subbrances from here.

### Contributing

1. Write your policy document or changes in either draft or draft@mypolicy
2. When you are happy with your document(s), go through the real life procedure
   of getting your changes approved (via either executive or membership vote)
3. If changes are approved, merge (don't rebase) your policy to master.
